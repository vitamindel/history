        <h2>Measuring Altitude and Ensuring Safety</h2>
        <p>Barometers play a crucial role in aviation, where they are used in altimeters to measure altitude. Altimeters, which are specialized barometers, provide pilots with essential information about their aircraftâ€™s height above sea level, ensuring safe navigation and collision avoidance.</p>
        <p>The basic principle involves measuring atmospheric pressure: as an aircraft climbs, the air pressure decreases, and this change is translated into altitude readings on the altimeter. Early altimeters were aneroid barometers, but modern aircraft use advanced electronic barometric systems for greater precision.</p>
        <p>Barometric readings are also used in weather forecasting and flight planning, helping pilots prepare for conditions like storms, wind changes, and turbulence. This integration of barometry has revolutionized aviation safety and efficiency.</p>
